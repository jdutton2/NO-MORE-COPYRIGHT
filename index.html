  <p>No one should be doing copyright its like stealing someones stuff. When you copyright you are stealing someones hard work, and i bet you dont want someone doing that to you. Why even copyright its so stupid and i think you are smart to know a answer on your own your just lazy. We need to just stop all the copyrighting and learn our own things, how are we going to learn if we just still other peoples work. Ethic should be considered because its important to use during certain items like use developer tools.
